01. [Audit] SAP security controls & Configuration Hardening Review
========================================================================================================================================================

SAP Security controls (CoBIT)
————————————————————————————————————————————
Note: The following list of security controls to check or perform are focus on the "technical" part and not on the "Business" part.

- The superuser "SAP*" is properly secured
- The default passwords for users "DDIC", "SAPCPIC" and "EarlyWatch" have been changed
- The powerful profiles are restricted (SAP_ALL, SAP_NEW)
- Logging & monitoring activities are in place for use of powerful accounts and profiles
- Changes made to the data dictionary are authorized and reviewed regularly
- Log and trace files are appropriately configured and secured
- SAP ERP Remote Function Call (RFC) and Common Programming Interface — Communications (CPI-C) are secured
- Access to information and information systems is authorized
- Information systems processing is protected physically from unauthorized access and from accidental or deliberate loss or damage
- Information processing can be recovered and resumed after operations have been interrupted
- Critical user activities can be maintained and recovered following interruption
- Configuration changes are made in the development environment and transported to production
- Changes to critical number ranges are controlled
- Access to system and customizing tables is narrowly restricted
- Application modifications are planned, tested and implemented in a phased manner
- Customized ABAP/4 programs are secured appropriately
- Batch processing operations are secured appropriately
- Critical and sensitive transaction codes are locked in production
- Strong password management for system users
- SAP Router is configured to act as a gateway to secure communications
- Remote access by software vendors is controlled adequately


Review the security level of the SAP Architecture/Infrastructure
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Check that the technology infrastructure is configured to secure communications and operations in the SAP ERP environment.
> Firewall
> SNC - Secure Network Communications (ideally should be set to « Privacy Protection »)
> Secure Store and Forward (SSF) mechanisms and digital signatures
> Workstation security
> Operating system (server) and database security
> Citrix Gateway and environment (if used)
> SAP Router configuration
> …


Security policy settings (password policy, network encryption, ..)
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Collect and Review the "RSPARAM" configuration file (Use the Tcode SA38 and then enter RSPARAM)
> login/password_expiration_time 			- Frequency of forced password change (default = 0 = off)
> login/min_password_letters				- Min. number of letters in passwords (default = 0)
> login/min_password_specials				- Min. number of special characters in passwords (default = 0) 
> login/min_password_lowercase				- Min. number of lower-case characters in passwords (default = 0) 
> login/fails_to_user_lock				- Number of invalid password attempts before user is locked (default = 12)
> login/failed_user_auto_unlock				- If user account is locked is it permanently locked until released by administrator or automatically unlocked at midnight (default = 1 = unlocked at midnight)
> rdisp/gui_auto_logout					- User is logged off of SAP after a period of inactivity (default = 7200 seconds = 2 hours)
> login/isable_multi_gui_login				- (default = 0 = multiple logons permitted)
NOTE: if multi-login is disabled some users can still be permitted multiple logins via the “login/multi_login_users” setting where user-ids can be listed which can be permitted to logon multiple times

Parameters				Description

* login/password_max_idle_productive		maximum #days a password (set by the user) can be unused (idle)

Notes:
The administration of security policies can be performed via the transaction SECPOL, which is secured by two authorization objects: S_SECPOL is checked during the maintenance of the policies themselves, while S_SECPOL_A is used to define the values that may be assigned to the security policy attributes.
Easy ways to see which users have security policies assigned to them:
=> Option 1:  SUIM: “Users > by Complex Selection Criteria” or “Users > by Logon Date and Password Change”
=> Option 2: Directly in table USR02 (field SECURITY_POLICY).


Check that SAP default passwords have been changed 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————
+ Default SAP Accounts and Passwords

   Login		 Password		Clients/Mandants
   =================================================================
   SAP* 		PASS or 06071992   	000, 001, 066  
   DDIC 		19920706		000, 001
   TSMADM 		PASSWORD		000, 001
   EARLYWATCH 	  	SUPPORT			066
   SAPCPIC 		ADMIN   		000, 001
   SAPR3 		SAP 			(SAP Local Database)


SAP Password Hash Formats in table USR02
—————————————————————————————————————————
If the field "CODVN" = « G » then the password code versions/formats will be B & F
If the field "CODVN" = « I » then the password code versions/formats will be B, F & H

Notes:
+ B = BCODE (MD5-based; Maximum pwd length=8, only upper case),
+ F = PASSCODE (SHA1-based; Maximum pwd length=40, case sensitive)
+ H = PWDSALTEDHASH  (iSSHA-1; Maximum pwd length=40, case sensitive)


Review the SAP Gateway Security Files (SECINFO and REGINFO)
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
> The "secinfo" security file is used to prevent unauthorized launching of external programs.
> The file "reginfo" controls the registration of external programs in the gateway. 
> Useful transaction to display and edit the files = SMGW 

You can define the file path using profile parameters gw/sec_info and gw/reg_info.
The default value is:
> gw/sec_info = $(DIR_DATA)/secinfo
> gw/reg_info = $(DIR_DATA)/reginfo


Example of a SECINFO file in new syntax
—————————————————————————————————————
#VERSION=2
D HOST=* USER=* TP=/bin/sap/cpict4				//Program cpict4 is not permitted to be started.
P HOST=* USER=* TP=/bin/sap/cpict*				//All other programs starting with cpict4 are allowed to be started (on every host and by every user).
P TP=hugo HOST=local USER=*					//Program hugo is allowed to be started on every local host and by every user.
P TP=* USER=* USER-HOST=internal HOST=internal 			//All programs started by hosts within the SAP system can be started on all hosts in the system.


Example of a REGINFO file in new syntax
—————————————————————————————————————
#VERSION=2
P TP=cpict4 HOST=10.18.210.140					//Program cpict4 is allowed to be registered if it arrives from the host with address 10.18.210.140.
D TP=* HOST=10.18.210.140					//All other programs from host 10.18.210.140 are not allowed to be registered.
P TP=cpict2 ACCESS=ld8060,localhost CANCEL=ld8060,localhost     //Program cpict2 is allowed to be registered, but can only be run and stopped on the local host or hostld8060.
P TP=cpict4							//Program cpict4 is allowed to be registered by any host.
P TP=* USER=* HOST=internal					//Programs within the system are allowed to register.

Different Types of Users in SAP
————————————————————————————————
There are five types of users in sap (useful link: https://www.stechies.com/type-of-users-in-sap/)

Dialog users (A)
-----------------
A normal dialog user is used for all logon types by exactly one person. This is used to logon using SAP GUI. During a dialog logon, the system checks for expired/initial passwords.
The user can change his or her own password. Multiple dialog logons are checked and, if appropriate, logged. These users are used for carrying out normal transactions. 
This is an interactive type of logon. 
The initial multiple logons are 6. 
They are set according to companies policy.

System Users (B)
-----------------
These are non interactive users. They are used for background processing and internal communication in the system (such as RFC users for ALE, Workflow, TMS, and CUA). 
Their passwords cannot be changed by the end users. Only the user administrator can change their passwords. 
Multiple logon is permitted in these type of users. Dialog logon is not possible for these type of users.

Communication Users (C)
------------------------
Used for dialog-free communication between systems. 
It is not possible to use this type of user for a dialog logon. 
Their passwords are valid for certain period of time so they expire. The users have option to change their own passwords.

Service User (S)
------------------
Dialog user available to a larger, anonymous group of users. 
The system does not check for expired/initial passwords during logon. 
Only the user administrator can change the passwords. Generally, highly restricted authorizations are given to this type of users.

Reference User (L)
----------------------
A reference user is, like the service user, a general non-person-related user. 
Dialog logon is not possible with this kind of user. 
A reference user is used only to assign additional authorizations. 
To assign a reference user to a dialog user, specify it when maintaining the dialog user on the Roles tab page.


========================================================================================================================================================
02. [Audit & Pentest] Unauthorized access to SAP tables and data using SAP transactions  (SAP application layer)
========================================================================================================================================================
Access to tables that include sensitive data should be carefully granted and monitored, specifically to inspect who is allowed to see/edit the data and who actually sees/edits it;
who is able to use the table in QuickViewer / Data Browser (...) and who actually did; in which views the table is being used and who viewed the data; and finally in which queries the table is used and who performed these queries.

There are multiple ways to display & edit tables in SAP
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
+ Standard table browsing and maintenance transactions: 
   > SE16 & SE16N (Data Browser), 
   > SE17 (General Table Display)
   > SM30 (Enhanced Table Maintenance Tool)
   > SM31 (Standard Table Maintenance Tool - Old)
+ Proxy-transactions like SPRO (which call the aforementioned ones internally).
+ SAP Query transactions: 
   > SQVI (SAP Quick Viewer), 
   > SQ01 (SAP Standard Query), 
   > SCMP (View / Table Comparison),
+ The ABAP report/program "RK_SE16N" that can be launched via the transaction SA38 (potential only / not tested).
+ The module pool "SAPMSVMA" that can be launched using SE38 (potential only / not tested).
+ Database monitoring tool (ST04).

Example of tables containing sensitive data
————————————————————————————————————————————
+ Useful "User Master Tables"
   > USR01 - User Master Records
   > USR02 - User IDs and Passwords (includes last logon data)
   > USH02 - password change history
   > VUSR02_PWD - View containing User IDs and Passwords
   > USR40 - Non-permissible password values
   > USR04 - User Master Authorizations
   > USR10 - Authorization Profiles  (i.e. &_SAP_ALL)
   > USR11 - User Master Profiles and Descriptions
   > USR12 - User Master Authorization Values

+ Useful "Authorization Tables"
   > UST04 - User Masters (all Users with profiles)
   > UST10C - User Master: Composite Profiles
   > UST10S - User Master: Simple profiles
   > UST12 - User Master: Authorizations
   > AGR_1250 - Role and. Authorization data.
   > AGR_DEFINE - To See All Roles (Role definition).	

+ Useful « Bank/Payment Tables »
   > T012 - House Banks
   > T012A / B - Allocation payment methods > Bank transfer
   > T012C - Terms for bank transactions
   > T012D - Parameter for DMEs and foreign PM
   > T012E - EDI-compatible house banks / PM
   > T012K - House Bank Accounts
   > T012O - ORBIAN Detail: Bank Accounts, ...
   > BNKA - Bank Master
   > TIBAN - IBAN (International Bank Account Number) 


SAP privilege escalation attack - Dump SAP password hashes from the table USR02 or the view VUSR02_PWD and crack them with « John The Ripper » 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
+ Read privilege over the table USR02 or the view VUSR02_PWD  (using SE16/SE16n, SM30, SQVI…) can allow a malevolent person to collect the password hashes of the SAP local accounts and then try to crack the passwords of SAP privileged accounts using « John The Ripper ».

+ Read privilege over the table USH02  (using SE16/SE16n, SM30, SQVI…) can allow a malevolent person to collect the old password hashes of SAP local accounts, then crack them using John The Ripper and try to guess the new one (based the old password pattern).

Tips for SAP passcode cracking:
+ SAP passcode (G format) collected in the USR02 table (for the SAP local account  « SAP_ADM ») : « 55D85A52F82E02FE246E9E505F0D2C9BC82C9E14 »
+ Password format to use with the tool « John The Ripper » : 
   > login:login$PASSCODE
   > SAP_ADM:SAP_ADM$55D85A52F82E02FE246E9E505F0D2C9BC82C9E14
+ Command to crack the passwords with « John The Ripper » : 
   > John --session=1 --format=sapg --wordlist=rockyou.txt  <File-containg-password-hashes>



SAP privilege escalation attack - Edit sensitive tables (e.g. USR02, USR04, USR10, USR11,…) using ST04 or SM30 or SM31
————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
+ Edit privilege over the users, authorizations and profiles tables could allow a malevolent person to escalate its privileges via multiple ways.
   For examples:
   > Create a new SAP administrator account (SAP_ALL, SAP_New, SAP Basis profiles)
   > Modify the password hashes of an existing SAP administrator account (e.g. SAP*, DDIC, …)
   > Add his/her account in a powerful group such as SAP_ALL, SAP_New or SAP Basis

+ Edit privilege over sensitive financial tables could allow a malevolent person to commit frauds by modifying suppliers/employees bank account numbers, pay slips and/or money transfers.

+ How to determine who can do table updates in production (should not be permitted)
   > SAP transactions = SM30, SM31 (and also ST04)
   > Object = S_TABU_DIS, (client independent tables also require S_TABU_CLI )
   > Activity = 01, 02
   > "sap_edit"


Defense tips & Recommendations
————————————————————————————————
+ Prevent users from being granted sensitive authorizations unless they genuinely need it for performing business tasks. 
   Users should be assigned only the minimum number of Authorizations required to perform their duties.
    > Note: Removing SE16N from S_TCODE (for a particular table), but allowing for instance SA38 or START_REPORT does not necessarily prevent direct table access. 
     It's not a big deal, since table authorizations are checked as usual… but keep in mind: removing the tcodes from S_TCODE has a limited effect unless you also take care of S_TABU_*, S_PROGRAM and S_DEVELOP
    (check SAP Note1012066 for the last one)!

+ Alert when a user:
   > Directly accesses a table (via SE16,..), especially a table which is defined as sensitive.
   > Performs a sensitive query.
   > Is granted a sensitive authorization.

+ Data Dictionary updates in production should not be permitted
   > TC = SE11, SE15, SE16, SE38, SE80
   > Object = S_DEVELOP
   > Activities = 01, 02, 06, 07 	



========================================================================================================================================================
03. [Audit & Pentest] Remote OS commands execution using SAP transactions (SAP application layer)
========================================================================================================================================================

There are several SAP transactions that allow authorized users to execute OS commands on the Windows/Linux server(s) hosting a SAP application/instance and/or a SAP database.
All the OS commands are executed by a local OS account « <SID>adm » which is used to manage the SAP software at the OS layer and which can log into the SAP database with high privileges.
If a malevolent person can execute any commands on the server(s) hosting a SAP application/instance with the « <SID>adm » account, then he/she can take over the entire SAP ERP application and data (OS => Database => Application).


+ [Method 1] Execute any OS commands on the server hosting the SAP application/instance using the transaction SA38 and the report "RSBDCOS0"
   > Go to transaction SA38 (Execute ABAP program/report)
   > Run the report "RSBDCOS0"
   > Execute any OS commands 
	> write and run a reverse shell, 
	> add a SSH public key and login to the Linux server, 
	> identify OS or database clear-text passwords stored in config files, scripts or .bash_history
 
   + Defense tips: Disable the CALL ‘SYSTEM’ command setting the profile parameter ‘rdisp/call_system’ to ‘0’.


+ [Method 2] Execute any OS commands on the server hosting the SAP application/instance using the transactions « SM69 + SM49 » or « SM69 + SM36 » or « SM69 + SM37 » 
   > Go to SM69 (Maintain external OS commands)
   > Then create a new external command or edit an existing one
   > Then set and save the OS command that you want to run
   > Finally execute it using either:
       SM49 (Execute external OS commands)
       or 
       SM36  (Simple job selection/scheduler) 
       or 
       SM37 (Extended job selection/scheduler)

    + Useful links: https://blogs.sap.com/2013/10/29/secure-execution-of-os-commands-by-abap-programs/


+ Method 3] Execute pre-defined/limited OS commands on the server hosting the SAP application/instance using the transactions SM49 or SM36 or SM37 
   Note: 
   In some cases by using the transactions CG3Z (File upload), CG3Y (File upload) and AL11 (SAP OS Directory and file browser) in addition to either SM49 or SM36 or SM37 it is possible to execute any OS commands.
   For example, if one of the pre-defined or customized OS commands available is to execute a script or a binary, then the following attack scenario is possible:
   > Go to CG3Y (File download)
   > Then select and download the script (or binary) that you are allow to execute
   > Go to CG3Z (File upload)
   > Select and upload/overwrite a malicious script (or binary) on the Windows/Linux server supporting the SAP application/instance 
   > Then execute it using either:
       SM49  (Execute external OS commands)
       or 
       SM36  (Simple job selection/scheduler) 
       or 
       SM37  (Extended job selection/scheduler)
   > Finally use CG3Z to replace your malicious script (or binary) by the legitimate one.


+ [Method 4] Execute any OS commands on the server hosting the SAP application/instance using the transaction(s) SE38 or « SE38 + SA38 » or « SE38 + SM36 » or « SE38 + SM37 » 
   > Go to SE38 (ABAP editor - create/edit/run ABAP program)
   > Create a new ABAP program (but you will need a developer key if you don't have a "developer" account)
   > Then execute it using either:
       SE38  (ABAP editor - create/edit/run ABAP program)
       or
       SA38  (Display/Execute ABAP program/report)
       or 
       SM36  (Simple job selection/scheduler) 
       or 
       SM37 (Extended job selection/scheduler)


+ [Method 5] Upload a backdoor on the server hosting the SAP application/instance using the transaction CG3Z (File upload)
   > Use CG3Z to overwrite a legitimate script (or binary) with a malicious one that will be more-likely executed later by a legitimate IT admin or a scheduled batch.


+ [Method 6] Execute any OS commands on the server hosting the SAP database using the transaction ST04 (remote OS command execution using Oracle or MSSQL database’s stored procedures)


SAP privilege escalation attack using remote OS commands
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Using one or several of the methods described above perform the following attack:

+ Step 1. Get an interactive session on the Windows/Linux server(s) hosting a SAP application/instance and/or a SAP database with the « <SID>adm » account.
   > Write and run a reverse shell (e.g. PowerShell, Python, Perl, Bash)
      OR
   > Add a SSH public key and then log into the Linux server, 
      OR
   > Identify privileged OS or database clear-text passwords stored in config files, scripts or logs (e.g. .bash_history) and then log into the server, 

+ Step 2.  Login to the SAP database (privileged access)

+ Step 3.  Steal and/or edit sensitive data stored in the SAP database to commit a fraud (for instance, modify bank accounts to receive fund transfers/payments)

+ Step 3.bis  Edit SAP tables to add a new SAP user with SAP_ALL privileges and then use this new account to commit fraud.



Other - SM59 and RSRFCCHECK
————————————————————————————————
Permet de lister les RFC (sm59) pour lesquels un mot de passe est sauvegarder 


Other - Scanning files content in AL11 
————————————————————————————————————————————
To start this functionality you can press Shift+F1 and a popup will show. Then you can inform which expression you would like to search.
Simply execute AL11 and then execute /NSU53 immediately afterwards. A report of all authorisations checked will then be displayed.

Other - Deleting a file (needs AL11 + SE37)
————————————————————————————————————————————
Step 1: Go to Transaction SE37, enter Function module name EPS_DELETE_FILE and click on execute button.
Step 2: Then, enter the File name in the FILE_NAME and the directory path (Excluding the file name) in the DIR_NAME and execute
Step 3: Finally use the AL11 transaction to check that the file has been deleted.

04. [Audit & Pentest] ABAP Debugger enabled in production environment  (SAP application layer)
========================================================================================================================================================
One of the major risks in SAP is its powerful debugging environment with the ability to stop each program and enter debugging mode while the program continues running (including the ability to change values at run time). 
The debugger allows bypassing certain controls (like authorization checks) and changing the system return-code (SY-SUBRC) for authorizations checks from Failed (4) to Succeeded (0).
This could allow a hacker to either change an account number while running a payment program or change a report selection value or change the password of SAP privileged account.


SAP privilege escalation attack - Bypass security controls with the ABAP Debugger
————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
+ If the ABAP Debugger is enabled in production, a malevolent person having read-only access to SAP tables with transactions such as SE16 or SE16n could bypass controls (authorizations checks) and modify data to perform a privilege escalation attack and/or a financial fraud. 
   > How-to: 
      https://sapbasissolutions.wordpress.com/2017/10/12/how-to-edit-sap-tables-without-coding-or-debugging/

+ If the ABAP Debugger is enabled in production, a malevolent person could bypass security controls to get unauthorized access to certain SAP transactions (goal: perform a privilege escalation attack or a financial fraud).

      https://blogs.sap.com/2013/09/06/abap-tip-and-trick-to-break-tcode-access-to-not-so-authorized-tcodes/


Defense tips & Recommendations
————————————————————————————————————————————
+ Remove debugging authorizations from all users while granting privileged access to users that really have to enter the debugging environment.

+ Define debugging as a sensitive authorization and receive an alert for when someone is granted such authorization.
   > The S_DEVELOP authorization object controls access to the debugger. 
   > You can locate the roles that contain the S_DEVELOP authorization object using the SUIM report "Roles by Authorisation Values".
   > You can locate the Users which have the S_DEVELOP authorization object using the SUIM report "Users by Authorisation Values".

+ Monitor users and their activities in the debugging environment.
   > If a user replace variables (with the debugging mode) it creates a system log message; check SM21 !

+ Eliminate authorization to change values in the debugger, and instead permit only display options.


========================================================================================================================================================
05. [Audit & Pentest] Sensitive information disclosure from SAP Spool (SAP application layer)
========================================================================================================================================================
One of the overlooked backdoors for getting valuable and sensitive data is the SAP spool. When a user/job prints in SAP, the output is first collected in the SAP spool (called Spool Request) and only then sent to the physical printer. 
Many times the spool request is not deleted from the spool (for a very long time), even after the content is printed. Clearly, this turns the SAP spool into an excellent source for hackers to find information about money transfer slips, monthly pay-slips, check printouts, purchase orders and more.
Furthermore, most users have access to the SAP spool (directly via T-Code SP01 or indirectly via T-Code SM37), and most organizations enable unlimited access to the spool items, including the options to view, download and re-print the content.

Defense tips & Recommendations
————————————————————————————————
+ Inspect which users access SAP spool items, especially those that were not created by them.
+ Define sensitive spool items by criteria and alert when they are accessed.

Remove developer keys from productive systems
Many auditors check on productive SAP systems if any developer keys exist (in table DEVACCESS). 
If there are any, this might become a finding that can easily avoid (… although the system is properly protected against changes in SCC4 and SE03).



========================================================================================================================================================
07. [Audit & Pentest] Weak SAP User and Access/Privileges Management (SAP application layer)

If the field "CODVN" = « G » then the password code versions/formats will be B & F
If the field "CODVN" = « I » then the password code versions/formats will be B, F & H

Notes:
+ B = BCODE (MD5-based; Maximum pwd length=8, only upper case),
+ F = PASSCODE (SHA1-based; Maximum pwd length=40, case sensitive)
+ H = PWDSALTEDHASH  (iSSHA-1; Maximum pwd length=40, case sensitive)

Weak parameter transactions
————————————————————————————————————————————
Parameter transactions execute an existing transaction delivering pre-defined screen input.
To determine all unsafe parameter transactions for SE16, SM30… you need to search for PARAMs matching "/N<TCD>" (e.g. "/NSM30*") in the table TSTCP.
=> The presence of "/*" indicates that the first screen is skipped and thus the view name cannot be overridden.
=> The presence of "/N<TCD>" (e.g. "/NSM30*") indicates that the first screen is not skipped and thus the pre-filled view name can be overridden (leaving the choice of the actual view name up to the user).

'SELECT * FROM SYS.M_DATABASE'
'SELECT * FROM SYS.M_HOST_INFORMATION'
'SELECT * FROM SYS.M_INIFILE_CONTENTS' 
'SELECT * FROM usr02;'

How to log into the database to extract the configuration
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

> [Option 1] The SAP HANA configuration can be collected using a “SAP Basis” account with the ‘ST04’ and ‘DBxx’ transactions

> [Option 2] Use SAP HANA HDBSQL to execute SQL commands at OS level.

	+ HDBSQL is a command line tool for executing commands on SAP HANA databases. SAP HANA HDBSQL is also used to automate the HANA Database backups using cron scripts. 
	+ Requirement: You want to access SQL prompt using HDBSQL at OS level. 
	+ Prerequisites : You need password of <SID>ADM user and User with HANA database access, in our example we are connecting using SYSTEM.
	+ Steps :
	• Logon to HANA host with <SID>adm user.
	• Once you are logged in as <SID>adm  you can directly execute the hdbsql command , or you can go to following path and execute the hdbsql command.  
	• cd /hana/shared/<SID>/hdbclient 
	• Now execute the command 
	• hdbsql  -n localhost -i 00 -u SYSTEM -p Ina123  

	Once you get the command , enter \s to get the system information you are connected to.
	Exit HDBSQL by entering the command: exit or quit or \q

	You can also log on with user credentials for the secure user store (hdbuserstore) with -U <user_key>. 
	HDBSQL Examples :
	---------------
	> hdbsql  -n localhost -i 00 -u SYSTEM -p Ina123;
	> hdbsql -S DEV -n localhost:30015 -u SYSTEM -p In123 ;
	> hdbsql -n localhost -i 00 -u myuser -p myuserpassword "select * from sys.users";
	> hdbsql -U myUserSecureStore "Select table_name, schema_name from m_tables" ;
	> hdbsql -U SUPER "SELECT * FROM SYS.P_CREDENTIALS_" ;
	> hdbsql -u SYSTEM -n HOSTNAME:34215 -s EEP -sslprovider commoncrypto -sslkeystore $SECUDIR/sapsrv.pse -ssltruststore $SECUDIR/sapsrv.pse "SELECT * FROM SYS.P_CREDENTIALS_" ; 


	Note:
	"A user administrator can exclude users from this password check with the following SQL statement: ALTER USER <user_name> DISABLE PASSWORD LIFETIME.
	 However, this is recommended only for technical users only, not database users that correspond to real people.
	 A user administrator can re-enable the password lifetime check for a user with the following SQL statement: ALTER USER <user_name> ENABLE PASSWORD LIFETIME."

SAP Discovery using Metasploit (Module 'sap_service_discovery' - https://www.metasploit.com)
—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Module to perform network scans against SAP platforms, which can be found under modules/ auxiliary/scanner/sap/sap_service_discovery.rb: 
msf  > use auxiliary/scanner/sap/sap_service_discovery.
msf  > set RHOST 192.168.1.149
msf  > exploit


SAP Router
————————————————————————————————————————————
Module to launch a port scanner through an SAProuter. 
The module is available on modules/auxiliary/scanner/sap/sap_router_portscanner.rb and allows two types of working modes: 
* SAP_PROTO: Allows port scanning when S(ecure) entries are set in the SAProuter ACL configuration. 
* TCP: Allows port scanning when P(ermit) entries are set in the SAProuter ACL configuration.

In order to ping the ICF component from the exterior and get basic information about it, the unauthenticated /sap/public/ info service
(ICF) can be used if enabled, and that’s just what the auxiliary/scanner/sap/sap_icf_public_info.rb 
> http://IP-address:8042/sap/public/info

Discovering ICF services with the mentioned module is as easy as shown below:

SMB Relay attacks using Metasploit
————————————————————————————————————————————
There is also an interesting attack that can target different SAP functions and is reachable via the SOAP RFC or other components
such as those in the J2EE engine—more about that later. 
While handling names, a lot of functions are vulnerable to SMB Relay Attacks. 
These attacks send an UNC path pointing to a server capturing SMB hashes, which can be disclosed when the vulnerable component tries to access it. 

> Some SMB Relay Attack attacks, both unauthenticated and authenticated, have been collected by @nmonkee in an auxiliary module located
  at /auxiliary/scanner/sap/sap_smb_relay.rb. 
> Module to run to capture the SMB Hashs (LMhash and NTHash): auxiliary/server/capture/smb module capturing SMB hashes

Alexander Polyakov and Dmitry Chastuhin presented work on the J2EE engine (SAPocalypse NOW: Crushing SAP’s J2EE Engine and Breaking SAP Portal). 
Attacks from the above presentations have been published as Metasploit modules: 
+ @nmonkee implemented the VERB tampering bypass (use HEAD as opposed to GET) to attack the ConfigServlet and create an operating system account. 
   > The module can be found at modules/auxiliary/scanner/sap/sap_ctc_verb_ tampering_user_mgmt.rb.

Exploiting SAPHostControl with Metasploit 
————————————————————————————————————————————
The component that provides the SOAP endpoint for the SAP Management Console on the TCP/50013 for the default instance is startsrv. 

According to the SAP documentation, the executable sapstartsrv runs in host mode for monitoring purposes only.
The interesting thing about this sapstartsrv component is that it’s also listening for SOAP requests. 

The GetDatabaseStatus call was attacked by Michael Jordon in order to get an arbitrary code execution from a command injection.
The exploit for this attack is also available on Metasploit as modules/exploits/windows/http/sap_host_control_cmd_ exec.rb.

It’s worth mentioning that the injection technique inspired @nmonkee when writing the OS command injections for the SXPG_CALL_SYSTEM_SXPG_CALL_ SYSTEM and SXPG_COMMAND_EXECUTE RFC SOAP calls
(remember also to check his post for more information about these command injections). 
The GetComputerSystem call was abused by Bruno Morisson to retrieve information related to the remote host without any authentication.
The exploit for this attack is available on modules/auxiliary/scanner/sap/sap_hostctrl_getcomputersystem.rb.
The next screenshot shows the information retrieved:

SAP NetWeaver Dispatcher
————————————————————————————————————————————
The disp+work.exe process is vulnerable to a buffer over ow (CVE-2012-2611) while handling Traces, which can be exploited with metasploit Module modules/exploits/windows/misc/sap_netweaver_dispatcher.rb: 
msf  exploit(sap_netweaver_dispatcher) > use exploit/windows/misc/sap_netweaver_dispatcher
msf  exploit(sap_netweaver_dispatcher) > set RHOST 192.168.1.149
RHOST => 192.168.1.149
msf  exploit(sap_netweaver_dispatcher) > exploit
